# Star-Challenge

Star Challenge is an open source port of the text based Star Trek strategy game written in 1971.  You can read the history of this game in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)).  This project is being developed as a .NET 6.0 console application.  Unfortunately, to prevent copyright issues with Paramount and CBS all references to Star Trek have been removed from the game.

This version of the game is based on a BASIC version called Star Challenge from the 1980 book 1001 Things To Do With Your Personal Computer by  Mark Sawusch.   Any lines numbers mentioned in the comments of the code reference this version.
