# Star-Challenge

Star Challenge is an open source port of the text based Star Trek strategy game written in 1971.  You can read the history of this game in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game)).  This project is being developed as a .NET 6.0 console application.  

This version of the game is based on a BASIC version called Star Challenge from the 1980 book [1001 Things To Do With Your Personal Computer by  Mark Sawusch](https://www.amazon.com/1001-Things-Your-Personal-Computer/dp/0830611606).   This version of the game is not the one with quadrant grid, star bases,and stars.  That version is call [Super Star Trek](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/super-star-trek).


## Objective

The objective of version 1 of this project is to convert all of the BASIC code to it's C# equviliant, determine the usage of all of the variable and arrays, and finally refactor the code. If there is still interest in the project my goal would be to start adding features from Super Star Trek.

## Design

There is a design folder that currently contains a flow chart of the original games logic.    I started this after I started coding becauce keeping up with all of the branching line numbers began to slow me down.   As they say "Weeks of coding will save you hours of planning."

If I expand the game passed the original text based adventure this is where any other design documents will be stored.
